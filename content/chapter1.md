# Introduction Volume 1
<br/>

**Melodies** are some of the most prominent elements in the world of music, no matter if they appear in the context of a classical piece, pop song, movie or video game soundtrack. Regardless of the musical language expressed, melodies make for one of the primary vehicles for conveying musical narrative and driving it forward.
<br/><br/>
Under the surface, melodies **encompass the essence of many fundamental concepts** that exist throughout the world of music, such as structure (motives, phrases, etc.), tonality and form. They also happen to be relatively accessible in terms of technical difficulty, at least for most musical instruments. As such, melodies make for an excellent starting point for learning how to improvise, both musically and technically.
